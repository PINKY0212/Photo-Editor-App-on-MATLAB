# Photo Editor Using MATLAB

## Overview
This project demonstrates basic image processing techniques using MATLAB, implemented both through direct command-line operations and a graphical user interface (GUI). The application allows users to perform various image manipulations such as grayscale conversion, edge detection, rotation, and histogram analysis.

## Features
- **Command-Line Operations**:
  - Image upload and display
  - RGB to grayscale conversion
  - Binary thresholding
  - Contrast adjustment
  - Histogram generation
  - Image metadata extraction

- **GUI-Based Operations**:
  - Upload and reset images
  - Convert images to grayscale
  - Apply complement (invert colors)
  - Detect edges using the Canny method
  - Rotate images clockwise/anticlockwise
  - Generate histograms

## How to Use
1. **Command-Line Mode**:
   - Open MATLAB and run the provided script in the editor or command window.
   - Ensure the input image (`crop.jpg` or `Gated LP-670.jpg`) is in the working directory.

2. **GUI Mode**:
   - Launch the GUI by running the `.fig` file in MATLAB (created using the `guide` tool).
   - Use the buttons to perform operations like uploading, converting, rotating, or analyzing images.

## Dependencies
MATLAB (tested on R2020b or later)

Image Processing Toolbox

## Conclusion

This project covers fundamental image processing techniques in MATLAB, emphasizing both script-based and GUI-driven approaches. It serves as a practical introduction to MATLAB's capabilities for image manipulation and analysis.
